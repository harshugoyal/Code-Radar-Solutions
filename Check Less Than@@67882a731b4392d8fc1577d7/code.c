Your C program has a few issues that need to be fixed for it to work correctly. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of your code:

Issues in your code:
Incorrect format specifier in scanf:

scanf("%.2f", &a); is incorrect.
%.2f is used in printf for formatted output but not in scanf. Since a is an integer, use %d instead.
Incorrect multiplication syntax for area calculation:

(3.14)(a)(a); is incorrect.
In C, multiplication should be explicitly written as 3.14 * a * a;.
Integer division issue:

area is declared as int, but 3.14 * a * a results in a floating-point value.
To store the correct value, area should be declared as float or double.
Corrected Code:
c
Copy
Edit
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    float a, area;  // Use float to store decimal values
    printf("Enter radius: ");
    scanf("%f", &a);  // Use %f for float input

    area = 3.14 * a * a;  // Correct multiplication syntax
    printf("Area: %.2f\n", area);  // Use %.2f for two decimal places

    return 0;
}
Example Input/Output:

Edit
Enter radius: 5
Area: 78.50
This corrected version ensures proper input handling and accurate area calculation. ðŸš€
